# RunScribe — High-Level Design

## Overview

RunScribe is a personal running fitness dashboard for analyzing Coros Pace 4 workout data.
It ingests `.fit` files (directly from Coros, Strava, Runalyze export, or manual upload),
computes Runalyze-style running statistics, and presents them in a rich, interactive web UI —
including maps, charts, GPS-tagged photo pins, gear tracking, goal progress, and auto-generated
training plans from Daniels and Pfitzinger methodologies. The entire application runs as a
Docker container.

Docker Compose:
  - backend  (FastAPI + APScheduler, port 8000)
  - frontend (Nginx serving Vite build, port 80)
  - volumes: ./data → /data  (SQLite DB + raw .fit files)
```

**Single-machine personal app.** Runs locally or on a personal VPS via Docker Compose.
No auth complexity for single-user local deployment.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Backend | Python 3.12 + FastAPI | Strong data science ecosystem; fitparse, numpy, pandas |
| Database | SQLite (via SQLModel/SQLAlchemy) | No infra overhead; sufficient for personal data volumes |
| Background jobs | APScheduler (in-process) | Simple periodic sync without Redis/Celery overhead |
| .fit parsing | `fitparse` library | Battle-tested ANT+ FIT format parser |
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite | Fast iteration; rich chart/map ecosystem |
| Maps | Leaflet.js + react-leaflet | Open-source, no API key required |
| Charts | Recharts | React-native, composable, good for time-series drill-down |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first; fast to prototype dashboard layouts |
| Containerisation | Docker + Docker Compose | Single-command startup; portable across machines |

## Data Sources

Priority order: Coros API → Strava API → Runalyze export → Manual `.fit` upload.
At least one source is always available; the others layer on additional richness.

### 1. Coros API
Coros offers an official partner API program (application required). There is also an
unofficial reverse-engineered API for bulk `.fit` export.

**Strategy:** Start with manual `.fit` upload to unblock development. Use unofficial Coros API
for historical bulk import. Apply for official API access for ongoing automated sync.

Coros training notes (post-workout journal entries) are available via the API.

### 2. Strava API (Activities + Photos)
If Coros API access is unavailable, Strava can serve as a full activity sync source — all
Coros runs auto-sync to Strava. The Strava API provides both activity streams (time-series GPS,
HR, pace) and activity photos.

Photos may carry EXIF GPS coordinates (from phone camera); these are extracted and used to
place photo markers at the correct location on the activity map.

Activities matched between Coros and Strava by start time (±60 seconds tolerance).

### 3. Runalyze Export
Runalyze allows bulk export of all activities as `.fit` files. This is a one-time historical
import path and requires no API credentials.

### 4. Manual `.fit` Upload
HTTP multipart upload via the API. Always-available fallback.
Files are stored verbatim — **no compression or lossy transformation of raw data.**

## Feature Modules

### Activity Ingestion
1. Parse `.fit` binary via `fitparse`
2. Extract all `record` messages → `DataPoint` rows (full resolution)
3. Compute derived aggregate fields → populate `Activity` row
4. Trigger Strava photo lookup if `strava_id` is known
5. Persist everything in a single transaction

### Running Statistics (Analytics Engine)
Computed on demand or cached on ingest. Modelled on Runalyze's metric set:

- **Pace zones** — time-in-zone breakdown by HR and pace
- **VDOT** — Jack Daniels formula from race-equivalent performance
- **Training Stress Score (TSS)** — HR-based (hrTSS) and pace-based
- **Acute Training Load (ATL) / Chronic Training Load (CTL) / Training Stress Balance (TSB)**
  — rolling 7-day / 42-day exponential weighted averages
- **Cadence distribution** — histogram
- **Grade-adjusted pace** — Strava GAP formula approximation
- **VO₂max estimate** — from HRmax, resting HR, and max pace segments

All computations operate on the raw `DataPoint` table — no pre-aggregated data needed.

### Interactive Map
- Full-resolution GPS track rendered with react-leaflet polyline
- Colour-coded by pace or HR (user-switchable)
- Click anywhere on the map ↔ highlights the matching point in the charts (bidirectional)
- Segment selection: drag to select a range → show stats for that segment only

### Precision Chart Analysis
- Recharts `LineChart` with brush/zoom component
- X-axis: elapsed time or distance
- Y-axes: pace, HR, elevation, cadence, power (toggleable overlays)
- Selecting a range on any chart syncs the map highlight and shows summary stats for the selection
- **No data downsampling** — renders all DataPoint records

### Photo Gallery & GPS Photo Pins
- Per-activity photo strip below the map
- Photos pulled from Strava at sync time and URL-cached
- Lightbox on click
- Photos with EXIF GPS coordinates are also rendered as map markers at their capture location
- Clicking a photo marker opens the photo in a lightbox

### Gear Tracking
- Assign shoes to an activity at upload or edit time
- Dashboard widget: distance per shoe, estimated remaining life vs. retirement threshold
- Retirement flag and replacement workflow

### Goals
- Create goals with a type, target, and date range
- Progress computed by summing activity metrics within the goal period
- Dashboard summary card shows all active goals with progress bars

### Training Plans
Generate structured multi-week training plans from two methodologies:

**Jack Daniels (Running Formula)**
- Input: goal race (distance + date), current VDOT (derived from recent race or estimated)
- Output: daily workouts with prescribed type (E/M/T/I/R) and distance, plus target paces
  computed from the VDOT tables (Easy, Marathon, Threshold, Interval, Repetition paces)
- Plans range from 5K to marathon; typically 12–24 weeks

**Pete Pfitzinger (Advanced Marathoning)**
- Input: goal marathon date, peak weekly mileage tier (55 / 70 / 85 mpw)
- Output: structured 18-week plan with long runs, medium-long runs, marathon pace workouts,
  lactate threshold runs, and recovery days
- Plan templates are encoded as structured data (week × day matrix)

**Compliance tracking:** Each `PlannedWorkout` can be linked to a completed `Activity` by
matching date and approximate distance (±20%). The plans page shows a calendar view with
completed workouts highlighted in green and missed ones in red.

## Open Questions

1. **Coros API access** — apply for official partner access or use the unofficial export tool for historical data? Start with manual upload to unblock development.
2. **Strava as full activity source** — if Coros runs auto-sync to Strava, Strava streams can substitute for `.fit` data. Requires confirming all workouts are synced and streams have full resolution.
3. **Hosting** — local-only (no auth needed) or self-hosted VPS (add simple API key or basic auth)?
4. **Map tile provider** — OpenStreetMap free tiles are sufficient; consider Mapbox for terrain/satellite view.
5. **EXIF GPS extraction** — Strava photo API returns URLs but may not include EXIF. May need to download the photo and extract EXIF client-side or server-side with `Pillow`/`exifread`.
6. **Pfitzinger plan encoding** — plan schedules are copyright; need to encode from the book manually as structured data, or use a freely available equivalent.
